The 'inputs' folder contains 2 datasets of financial time series that I recieved from my friends at TenViz. They were accompanied with a couple of challenges. The challenges with my solutions are described in the Jupyter notebooks in the 'analysis' folder. 
* In the first challenge I build a classifier model for the time series (in my case an LSTM RNN model). 
* In the second challenge I implement and compare various regression metrics to evaluate forecast performance.
